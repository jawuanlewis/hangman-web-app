# hangman-web-app

This is source code for my own personal, web-based version of the game **_Hangman_**.
There will be four available themes of words to guess (sports, movies, video games, and fun phrases/idioms).

**NOTE**: The project is still in progress, but to test out its current state:

- Download the project ZIP and save to your computer
- Navigate to the project directory in a terminal
- Run `node app.js` (Note: must have Node.js set up)
- Open the given localhost link in a browser
