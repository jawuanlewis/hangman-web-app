# hangman-web-app

This is source code for my own personal, web-based version of the game **_Hangman_**.
There are 4 available themes of words for players to guess (sports, movies, video games, and fun phrases/idioms), with more to come in the future.

NOTE: Currently migrating this project from EJS and vanilla JavaScript to React (enhancing efficiency and maintainability).

Open [this link](https://hangman-web-app-466f2d94c639.herokuapp.com/) to access and play the game!
